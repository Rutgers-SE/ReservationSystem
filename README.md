# Reservation System

Nothing from the garage repo should be managed in this git repo. This is purely for creating reservations, and creating users.

## Backend Heavy
- [x] Basic User authentication
- [ ] Payment Controller
  - [x] Setup Stripe Account
  - [x] Integrate Stripe into Rails
  - [ ] Create UI for the Owner to change prices
	- [ ] Integrate this into the owner dashboard
- [ ] Reservation Creation
- [ ] Garage HTTP Interface Controller
- [ ] Owner Finance Panel
- [ ] Admin Switch Panel


## Frontend heavy

This portion should be left for the final demo. In this portion, we will be converting the static pages that are generated at every request into single page applications.

- [ ] Convert CRUD into single page experiences.
  - [ ] User
  - [ ] Reservation
  - [ ] Admin Switch Panel

### Payment Testing

#### Filling in the form
- Email must be the email of the user.
- Credit card should be one of the number from the table below
  - Unless "remember me" button is clicked. If so, to token generated by stripe should be saved into the payment database.
- Any future day can be used as the credit card exiration date.
- Any CVC number can be used (try 3 or 4 digits)
